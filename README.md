# uber-data-analysis
This a side project I encountered on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city) and thought would be a fun R excercise to do! I used the ["uber-raw-data-janjune-15.csv"](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city?select=uber-raw-data-janjune-15.csv) to analyze and answer different questions, based on the data from the first six months of 2015, from New York City. With the use of packages like dplyr and ggplot2, I was able to visualize Uber pickup and distribution in New York City (i.e. visualize the pickups per month and extract the general trend over the 6 months) as well as the distribution of pickups by days of the week, per month.
