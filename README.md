# uber-data-analysis
This a side project I encountered on kaggle and thought would be a fun R excercise to do! I used the "uber-raw-data-janjune-15.csv" to analyze and answer different questions, based on the data from the first six months of 2015. With the use of packages like dplyr and ggplot2, I was able to visualize Uber pickup and distribution in New York City (i.e. visualize the pickups per month and extract the general trend over the 6 months) as well as the distribution of pickups by days of the week, per month.
